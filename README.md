# Linked List Implementation in Python

## Overview
This Python code implements a basic linked list data structure using two classes: `Node` and `LinkedList`. The `Node` class represents each node in the linked list, while the `LinkedList` class provides methods for manipulating the list.

## Node Class
The `Node` class defines a single node in the linked list. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.

## LinkedList Class
The `LinkedList` class represents the linked list itself. It has a head node, which points to the first node in the list.

## Methods
`insert_beginning(new_value)`: Inserts a new node with the given value at the beginning of the list.
